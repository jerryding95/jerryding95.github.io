        **LLM-agent serving on heterogeneous GPUs**
    
        The agentic workloads demonstrate different characteristics from LLM inferencing. We are exploring agent-serving frameworks with better cost-performance tradeoffs on heterogeneous GPUs.

        **Software-Defined Cooling**

        During an internship at Azure Research - Systems, we proposed software-defined hybrid cooling in next-generation AI datacenters, studied possible use cases thoroughly, and achieved comparable PUE with current industry practice while minimizing water usage. (in-submission work)

        **The <a href="https://cs.uchicago.edu/news/new-updown-project-uses-intelligent-data-movement-to-accelerate-graph-analytics/">UpDown</a> system project**

        The Updown system is a large-scale distributed computing system that enables flexible graph representation and programmable intelligence to move it within the system. We build and explore efficient and scalable computation over massive graph structures in this system.

        My interest and work falls into the intelligent and adaptive data movement and assignment to solve large-scale load-balancing problems. (in-submission work)


        **Distributed power management** (SC' 23)

        The increase in modern cluster scale following Moore’s law is leaving power support behind. Fully powering an exascale cluster is neither realistic nor safe. Thus overprovisioned systems, clusters under a power cap, are proposed for exascale clusters to operate functionally. We explored distributed power management for such large-scale clusters.

        **Cache allocation performance modeling** (ICAC' 19)

        Recent CPU architecture allows for customized cache allocation strategies. This opens new opportunities for computational sprinting to meet high-level user-defined goals.

        **The <a href="https://cs.uchicago.edu/news/new-updown-project-uses-intelligent-data-movement-to-accelerate-graph-analytics/">UpDown</a> system project**

        The Updown system is a large-scale distributed computing system that enables flexible graph representation and programmable intelligence to move it within the system. We build and explore efficient and scalable computation over massive graph structures in this system.

        My interest and work falls into the intelligent and adaptive data movement and assignment to solve large-scale load-balancing problems. (ongoing work)


        **Distributed power management** (SC' 23)

        The increase in modern cluster scale following Mooreâ€™s law is leaving power support behind. Fully powering an exascale cluster is neither realistic nor safe. Thus overprovisioned systems, clusters under a power cap, are proposed for exascale clusters to operate functionally. We explored distributed power management for such large-scale clusters.

        **Cache allocation performance modeling** (ICAC' 19)

        Recent CPU architecture allows for customized cache allocation strategies. This opens new opportunities for computational sprinting to meet high-level user-defined goals.
